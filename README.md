## Husky Installation
-  `yarn` is needed since `husky` is using it to run `prettier`
- `git pull`; make sure your codebase is up to date!
- `yarn install`; install the latest dependencies!
- `yarn prepare` or `npm run prepare`; this will install `husky`
- voila! you're ready to make a `commit`!
- *PS: you only need to do the installation once*
